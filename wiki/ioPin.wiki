#summary IO Pin headers

= Introduction =

The headers found in _io_pin_ directory are similar to the _io_ headers provided by _avr-libc_. Simply include the _io_pin.h_ header to use it.

These headers map function pins to their respective ports. This way, it is easier to create portable code across devices.

= Warning =

Headers are script generated from _Atmel's_ _XML_ which are known to contains errors. Open an issue if you find anything wrong in _io_pin_ headers. The project keeps track of changes made to _Atmel's_ _XML_ in order to provide the most accurate information. _Atmel_ has been informed for most error found in their _XML_ and they are slow to react(_XML_ are taken from _AVR_ _Studio_ releases, which is not that often), if they react at all.

= Usage =

The example bellow allows to enable the pull-up on the _TWI_ pins. 

{{{
#include "io_pin/io_pin.h"

void twi_enable_pullup(void)
{
    SDA_PORT |= _BV(SDA_BIT);
    SCL_PORT |= _BV(SCL_BIT);
}

}}}
